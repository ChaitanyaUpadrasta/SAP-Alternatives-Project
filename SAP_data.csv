All rights reserved..com/products/access-control.htmlSecuring Your Business in the Digital Age4 / 13REDUCINGFRICTIONBETWEENUSERSANDAPPLICATIONSTo do their jobs in a digital world, internal and external users must interact with applications that are critical to conducting business. But increasing numbers of rules for data protection, such as the recently enacted General Data Protection Regula-tion (GDPR) for businesses active in the European Union, continually add to the pressure to protect privacy and personal data. You must strike a care-ful balance between granting users access to business applications and ensuring the security of those applications and the valuable data they contain. That traditionally meant having users complete a range of manual compliance and security checks before you assign roles and grant access. Such mechanisms can be time-consuming, erecting a barrier between users and their tools and causing delays to access approval that decrease user productivity. A key mission of effective access governance is to reduce friction by making that access barrier simpler to navigate while at the same time incor-porating necessary checks to ensure security, reduce application misuse, and mitigate the risk of fraud. And as the pace of the marketplace continues to accelerate toward real-time busi-ness, user-access requests and changes must also be speedy and accurate. You need to avoid administrative delays so that business users can get on with doing their jobs and improving your business outcomes.CONTROLLINGWHOCANHAVEACCESSTOWHATClearly, you need a comprehensive approach to governing who can have access to what systems, applications, and data across your enterprise without leaving your business open to noncom-pliant access. As many recent high-profile cases have demonstrated, unauthorized users can undertake fraudulent action that damages your reputation and causes huge financial losses. Regardless of the line of business employees belong to, they each need a digital identity that defines the entitlements they need to complete their tasks. Whether they access your systems from the office, their homes, or remote parts of the world, such a digital identity grants them entrance to areas where they can operate securely in their business capacity. Figure 1 illus-trates the ideal reach of a digital identity across the enterprise.Governing Access Efficiently in a Hyperconnected WorldDigitalization increases access and security challenges exponentially. In an age of mobile workforces, complex business networks, strict data protection requirements, and ever-present identity and cybersecurity threats, youneedrobustaccessgover-nance more than ever. You must give users appropriate access to applications and data to perform their tasks, while ensuring that access governance processes pre-vent misuse and adhere to internal security policies and external compliance regulations. 2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

All rights reserved.Securing Your Business in the Digital Age7 / 13Analyzing Risk and Monitoring AuthorizationsThe primary goal of risk analysis is to find and remediate segregation-of-duties (SoD) and critical-access violations. With SAP Access Control, you can perform a cross-system analysis of these violations in real time or in offline mode. Either way, you identify potential risks using a comprehensive rule set for the most common business functions and associated risks.WORKINGWITHTHERULESSETThe rules set is based on best practices and compatible with the SAP ERP application, SAP S/4HANA , and other similar software applications. The rules let you monitor risks to business applications throughout the enterprise to establish a consistent policy and prevent siloed approaches to separate environments. If the analysis identifies violations, business managers receive notification in user-friendly terms and can review the issues and then act to remediate the risks using a set of mitigating controls you configure to meet your local require-ments. Even after you conduct an initial cleanup, new risks may arise on a daily basis as user assignments and business needs change. Built-in simulation functionality lets you examine the effects of proposed authorization changes for users and roles before modifying access rules.TAKINGADVANTAGEOFMODERN DASHBOARDSANDOVERVIEWPAGESEfficient role-based, interactive dashboards such as the one in Figure 3 capitalize on the modern look of the SAP Fiori user experience to help you gain visibility into user-access assignments, activities, and risks.Figure3:Cross-SystemLookatUserandRoleAssignments 2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

All rights reserved.Securing Your Business in the Digital Age9 / 13Provisioning Users and Maintaining RolesSAP Access Control automates the provisioning of users and the design and maintenance of business roles, building access-risk analysis into those processes. The application collects trans-action usage data and provides details on SoD conflicts and critical transactions, with date and time stamps and the IDs of users involved. You can enable alert functions to notify process owners when users execute transactions that violate rules in your rule set. The application also includes a self-service password change mechanism and automates access management activities throughout the employee lifecycle.IDENTIFYINGCONFLICTSANDAPPROVINGACCESSREQUESTSEmployees can request access and managers can approve their requests using SAP Fiori apps for access request and approval. Additional mechanisms for access request and approval include integration with: . HR software, including SAP SuccessFactors solutions, which can trigger changes to user assignments based on new-hire, transfer, or termination actions . The SAP Single Sign-On application, the SAP Identity Management component, and third-party identity management software running through standard Web servicesDEFININGANDSYNCHRONIZINGROLESA configurable methodology for role definition and maintenance helps you close the loop between business and technical owners with a collaborative role governance process and end-to-end automation for user provisioning. Comprehensive definition of business roles reduces maintenance costs and improves the user experience. You can apply definitions to multiple roles at a time to simplify updates to provisioning. And bulk maintenance capabilities help you administer role approvers and role owners efficiently. MANAGINGACCESSACROSSTHEEXTENDEDENTERPRISESAP Access Control includes access risk analysis for SAP Fiori apps and for SAP S/4HANA, plus emergency access for the SAP HANA business data platform. It provides integration to share roles and privileges with SAP Identity Manage-ment as well.Built-in simulation functionality lets you examine the effects of proposed authorization changes before modifying access rules.  2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.Securing Your Business in the Digital Age10 / 13Regulating Privileged Access and Monitoring UsageBusiness and IT users alike sometimes need privileged or firefighter access to SAP ERP, SAP S/4HANA, and analytic applications based on SAP HANA. Accounting personnel may need to post payments manually during month-end close, for example. Or IT personnel may need elevated access to troubleshoot critical business systems. If access is too severely restricted, costly and unproductive delays can occur during approval and setup of such temporary new privi-leges. SAP Access Control helps you negotiate these trade-offs by streamlining administration of elevated permissions. MANAGINGEMERGENCYACCESSClosed-loop monitoring and management of emergency access, including detailed displays from firefighter logs, helps you monitor tempo-rary assignments through careful postsession tracking and reporting. You can rely on a built-in, fully auditable process to manage emergency access centrally for all SAP software systems. You can track and resolve superuser inconsisten-cies online and ease the administration burden by reducing the number of repetitive assign-ments. You can also capitalize on usage detail during user-access reviews to determine whether users need to maintain previously established access to firefighter roles. The resulting savings in user-access administration time become especially significant when you upgrade software or redesign security systems. As illustrated in Figure 4, SAP Access Control gives you proactive notification of conflicting or sensitive firefighter actions so you can keep a close eye on them and take remedial action before damage occurs. The application keeps a full audit trail of transactions executed and risks flagged.Figure4:SampleRiskViolationAlertsforSensitiveActions 2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.Securing Your Business in the Digital Age11 / 13CERTIFYINGAUTHORIZATIONSSAP Access Control automates periodic certification reviews, which help you ensure user assignments remain consistent with job functions. Such proce-dures are required by law in most nations and considered best practices in most industries even when not mandated by government regulations.  Certification defines the scope of each review and sends the set of reviews through an administrative pass to help ensure each addresses the correct reviewer and lists the correct users. Once that pass is complete, the system distributes the reviews to appropriate coordinators, who follow up to complete them in a specified time period. The reviews include recommended remediation activities for SoD and critical access risks, to help you minimize audit time and cost downstream.Periodic certification reviews help you ensure user assignments remain consistent with job functions.  2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

Stakeholders now want to know that businesses in which they are involved are making responsible decisions, are healthy in every aspect, and that they are resilient and compliant. Today, stakeholders want to see evidence, on demand and in real time, that an organization which they are backing is managing their financial, social, and environmental activities efficiently, profitably, and responsibly. They want to see clear corporate accountability in governance, risk, and compliance.Risk management measures that are taken to meet this demand can often be frustrating for senior managers who feel distracted from doing their day-to-day work. Often the plans and their execution are ineffective and unstructured.Any risk management measures must focus on the specific value drivers unique to the business and these can be difficult for you to identify. Managers must look beyond financial line items to the activities and processes that are integral to the organization's business model. For example, for an airline the customer experience may be a crucial value driver. For a utility company, reliability is key. For oil and gas, it's proved reserves or refinery capacity.Raising the standard for measuring successSAP Solution Brief BenefitsSolution Quick Facts  2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

It's not enough to set up teams to deal with new regulations, as rules increase faster than your resources. The key to sustainable governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) management is repeatable process controls that help you do more with less.The fact is, businesses are operating during a period of greater risk and volatility, increasing the potential for catastrophic losses and compliance failures as they grow, innovate, and drive new efficien-cies through real-time, automated, and intelligent processes. So it's more critical than ever to have a complete view of risk and compliance needs and a systematic way of identifying and managing controls where they are most needed.This requires consistent data standards and an automated, repeatable process for gathering data and designing appropriate controls. The SAP Process Control application helps by simpli-fying and automating continuous control monitoring across the enterprise. By facilitating the sharing of risk and control frameworks and data, it helps you prioritize control activities, ensure GRC information is always up to date, and achieve sustainable compliance at a lower cost.Focus limited GRC resources on what matters mostSAP Solution Brief BenefitsSolution Quick Facts  2019 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.3 / 12A continuous control monitoring solutionSAP Process Control is one of the core applications offered by SAP that supports the ""three lines of defense"" framework, which clearly defines the key roles and accountabilities for operating manage-ment, corporate departments, and internal audit departments responsible for adding and preserving business value. Key SAP applications enabling this framework include: . SAP Process Control. SAP Risk Management . SAP Business Integrity Screening . SAP Audit Management With SAP Process Control, you benefit from contin-uous control monitoring that enables you to: . Automate key compliance and control activities to prioritize effort and reduce costs. Provide continuous insight into the status of compliance and controls for faster, more effective action .

At the same time, it supports standardized docu-mentation of controls, easy sharing and reuse of compliance and control structures, and collaborative policy maintenance and approvals.Having a single source of truth lays the foundation for a robust, multiple-compliance framework for documenting, testing, and reporting across regulations and company initiatives. This greatly reduces manual effort, increases visibility, and moves your organization toward more streamlined, harmonized processes. For example, once you document a control, you can assign it to as many risks, regulations, and initiatives as needed while capturing the data specific to each risk and regu-lation to monitor control effectiveness. You can also apply evaluations defined for a given control to wherever it was implemented across the enter-prise, saving time and effort. Replicating and reusing controls and evaluations simplifies geographic expansion and makes it easier to scale to new regulations and initiatives.BenefitsSolutionObjectives Quick FactsSAP Solution BriefA continuous control monitoring solutionDocument: Create a single source of truth Plan: Focus on actions to help ensure timelinessExecute performance monitoring: Manual and automatedEvaluate: Test control design and remediate issuesReport: Gain insight for analysis and accountability  2019 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

The goal is to have not only fewer controls but also efficient and strong controls where there is significant value at stake or higher risk to the business. SAP Process Control helps by enabling you to:. Assess the most significant risks to your business and its most critical processes. Identify the top regulatory mandates your company is subject to. Manage your policy lifecycles. Determine the right controls and where they are most needed . Select the right scope and test strategies. Trigger workflow-driven performance, assess-ments, and tests of control effectiveness. Define and schedule continuous control monitoring rules. Distribute policies and related surveys.

SAP Process Control, which is the control engine at the core of SAP GRC solu-tions, uses integration with other SAP GRC solutions and business systems (such as ERP software) to continuously monitor controls and help ensure that: . Your key risks are identified and mitigated continuously. You sustain compliance to key regulatory mandates. Business processes are always monitored (not just between cycles) to perform as requiredThe continuous control monitoring functionality is based on scheduled, event-driven rules. Put simply, the rules work on a ""set it and forget it"" basis so you know the system is always monitoring SAP and non-SAP software systems without the need for regular attention by users. When exceptions (defined as data that meets the rules' deficiency criteria) are detected, they are routed automatically to the correct person for review and possible reme-diation. Any data that does not meet the deficiency criteria is ignored, and no workflow is sent, so business users can manage by exception. This reduces workloads and helps ensure control issues receive proper and prompt attention.

An organization owner, for example, can be assigned overall responsibility for processes, subprocesses, and controls within their organization. They can then use SAP Process Control to assign ownership of specific processes and tasks at various levels, all the way down to individual control owners. These entity-level application roles not only determine reporting responsibility and visibility but also route workflows to the responsible person. In this way, SAP Process Control supports authorization, reporting responsibility, and appropriate routing of tasks without the need for expensive workflow customization or even IT assistance.

For each match group, the application builds a best record using fields from multiple source records based on survivorship rules. You can then replicate the validated best records back into the transactional applications or to a data warehouse to help improve business process efficiency and business analysis.The application supports centralized creation and maintenance of master data. This helps automate governance by controlling data quality at the point of authorship. By integrating data governance into business processes, you can help ensure that duplicate checks and field validations are performed before a new record is created. Standardized and automated workflow routing and notification help ensure participation from the right people at the right time, and they increase overall productivity. Version control and an audit history improve transparency and help ensure policy and regulatory compliance.

A wide array of movement mechanisms is supported, including Web services, application link enabling, remote function calls, and file transfers, and orchestration is independent of the mechanism used. The application keeps track of what data needs to be distributed where and what has been distributed successfully, or not, at the level of master data object. Target systems can subscribe to the distribution of master data based on filter criteria and delta tracking, which enables tailored selection of master data for specific applications.SAP Master Data Governance also provides keyand value-mapping capabilities to support scenarios where the same master data object is used in different systems with different identifiers. Key mapping is used when the primary key for a supplier is different in various systems, and it helps ensure that you know which primary keys represent the same thing in different systems. Value mapping is used when codes used in master data attributes are different between systems, and it helps ensure proper translating when you are distributing master data between systems.  2019 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

The world is leveraging new technology and working with a completely new set of state-of-the-art tools. It's time for you to do the same with advanced solutions that will transform the way you work from day one. In its 2018 state of the internal audit profession study, PwC shows that 56 % of IA leaders believe technology adoption impacts IA's value to the organization. 66% of IA leaders view missing risks as a top threat to not improving technology adoption. In other words, internal auditors are not providing assurance or insight into critical business risks.Clearly, internal audit departments are being called upon to raise their games. This elevation requires a progressive shift along the technology maturity curve to go beyond traditional auditing. It entails integrating ad hoc and predictive analytics and using continuous risk assessment and auditing to provide ongoing assurance across the enterprise.It's time to advance along the technology curveSAP Solution Brief BenefitsSolution Quick Facts  2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

All rights reserved.2 / 7ObjectivesIncrease both user satisfaction and operational efficiencyIf you could automate the many mundane and recurring manual activities that occur throughout your organization, you could increase user satisfaction and operational efficiencies simultaneously. Your employees could focus on more-important activities, and your organization benefits from the greater precision, speed, and accuracy that automation can deliver. But how can you achieve this automation? Many manual processes have remained manual processes because of their complexity. Traditional automation tools and user interfaces may not lend themselves to capturing and automating the more subtle aspects of these processes. That's where SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation (SAP Intelligent RPA) services distin-guish themselves. After capturing user activity, intelligent bots delivered by these services can emulate user interactions with software and digitally execute some of the user's tasks. Because these bots can take advantage of SAP Leonardo Artificial Intelligence (SAP Leonardo AI) capabilities and SAP Conversational AI services, they can automate actions that involve more than a traditional user interface. They can work with process metadata to support hands-free execution of much more complicated processes. As a result, your intelligent enterprise can run faster, leaner, and more cost-effectively, all while better serving customers.Increase both user satisfaction and operational efficiencySAP Solution Brief BenefitsSolution Quick Facts  2019 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.3 / 7Eliminate repetitive manual processes Automation is a key characteristic of intelligent enterprises. It can enable you to complete previ-ously manual tasks more quickly, more consistently, and more precisely. Particularly when processes are complicated but mundane, automation can help reduce human error and free employees to focus on activities that translate directly into better products, services, and customer experiences.What do such manual processes look like? Con-sider an employee who must process a shipping manifest. The employee might enter the shipping number into a Web application to get the related purchase order. They might then send purchase order information into a cloud-based ERP for further processing. Such processes are complex, manual, and error-prone even under the best circumstances. More-complex processes can have even more steps, involve more systems, and create more opportu-nities for error. SAP Intelligent RPA helps your organization unshackle itself from such inefficiencies. Intelligent bots can perform these complex tasks faster, with more consistency, and with far fewer errors.Eliminate repetitive manual processes Deliver greater speed and accuracyPower automation with intelligence Solution BenefitsObjectives Quick FactsIntelligent bots can execute processes spanning multiple systems, multiple cloud solutions, and even multiple software-as-a-service offerings.SAP Solution Brief  2019 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

The services' design studio facilitates application capture, visual workflow sequencing, scripting, and debugging. You can: . Design bots with step-by-step execution sequences and dependencies . Attach trigger mechanisms to bots for attended or scheduled-unattended execution . Use APIs and machine learning services to make bots intelligentThe services also provide features that enable you to manage the degree to which a bot operates autonomously:  . Digital assistant: The digital assistant function-ality lets you improve process performance by streamlining some or all aspects of a manual process. In this automation mode, your users interact directly with the bots, achieving greater efficiency through synergy. . Digital worker: A repetitive process that does not require intermittent decision-making may be a good candidate for the digital worker component, which enables you to automatically execute a complete process without human intervention.  . Cloud orchestration factory: The cloud orchestra-tion factory functionality acts as both a controller and a dashboard, managing process automation resource assignments through either digital assistants or digital worker capabilities.BenefitsSolutionObjectives Quick FactsSAP Solution BriefEliminate repetitive manual processes Deliver greater speed and accuracyPower automation with intelligence   2019 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.5 / 7Power automation with intelligence Bots created with SAP Intelligent RPA interact with other systems at the human task layer, just as humans do. This makes sense, as the bots rep-licate the work that a person would be doing. In fact, in an intelligent enterprise, many bots may be interacting with other bots. So what happens if a user interface changes or a system is updated? A human user would strive to adjust, to adapt to the new interface. But what about bots? The answer to this question speaks to the intelli-gence of the SAP Intelligent RPA services.BenefitsSolutionObjectives Quick FactsSAP Solution BriefUsing SAP Leonardo AI capabilities, the bots can identify and learn new patterns without explicit training. Those same capabilities enable intelligent bots to process and understand unstructured data from e-mails, images, and PDFs.Using SAP Conversational AI services, bots can interact with customers and users in the same manner a person would. And you don't need to predefine inputs and outputs or code into the bot every conversational possibility.

Intelligent bots created using the services can execute repeti-tive manual processes quickly, consistently, and without error. They can scale in step with the needs of your enterprise, which can help you respond proactively to emerging opportunities and evolving customer needs. And these are not the only benefits you can gain from SAP Intelligent RPA. Intelligent bots can help you reinvent processes and drive continuous improvement. They can help you make smarter decisions and overcome organizational barriers. In short, they can help your organization move ever further along the path of becoming an intelligent enterprise.

Because it streamlines every process across your business that uses content of any kind, the SAP Extended Enterprise Content Management (SAP Extended ECM) application by OpenText helps you maxi-mize your return from all three components. It helps you create a unified, omnichannel customer experience and boost employee engagement through collaboration. It also lets you work with Ariba Network to discover optimal suppliers and tighten supply chain and spend manage-ment.

Keeping Internet users engaged takes customized offers and communications, contextualized to the moment and consistent across channels. Your marketing staff depends on a real-time customer profile, offering a 360-degree view that includes transaction history, application data, and data from e-mail messages and digital assets. The SAP Digital Asset Management solution by OpenText works with SAP Extended ECM to handle the Microsoft Word and PDF files, images, and rich media assets – even if they originate in non-SAP applications. You can provide a unified in-store or online experi-ence because your branding stays consistent with every interaction.

They collaborate closely across key business functions, providing critical input to ensure successful achievement of operational and financial performance objectives.QUANTIFYING THE COSTS OF OUTDATED GLOBAL TRADE PROCESSESOrganizations across all industries are reexamin-ing their global footprint in light of geopolitical upheaval occurring around the world, as well as changes to market opportunities, tariffs, and free trade agreements. But globalization also increases the complexity of cross-border trade, bringing both opportunities and risks. The SAP Global Trade Services (SAP GTS ) applica-tion gives you confidence that your business processes are compliant with complex global trade regulations while enabling a high-velocity supply chain.MOVING BEYOND MANUAL AND LEGACY GLOBAL TRADE SYSTEMSAs companies increase participation in global trade, their need for effective global trade man-agement increases as well. Managing global trade in accordance with the ever-evolving laby-rinth of regulatory requirements, geopolitical risks, changing market opportunities, tariffs, and free trade agreements can make or break the success of your globalization strategy.The challenge is that global trade is typically managed using antiquated manual processes and legacy global trade systems that simply can't address the complexities of global trade today. For example, fragmented legacy systems break the natural rhythm of information flow, with cross-border order and shipment data pass-ing through separate systems for transactions, screening, and approval. This complicated information flow results in delays of export orders that must be screened, inbound shipments that are unable to rapidly clear customs, and a lack of reports that decision-makers need to monitor free trade compliance. In addition to causing delays, having separate systems for managing global trade prevents timely visibility into orders and shipments – including those that may be violating regulations. As companies add new products, move into new markets, or increase trade volume, they are find-ing that their manual and legacy systems can't keep up, compounding these challenges. Customer orders don't ship on time, businesses can't take advantage of duty-relief and duty-suspension programs, and compliance risk increases. With SAP GTS, you can address these challenges by bringing real-time global trade management capabilities to your business processes. 2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

All rights reserved.Run Worldwide with SAP Global Trade Services 6 / 16Running Compliance WorldwideGlobal trade is a complex, regulatory-driven business – and getting it right for every order and shipment requires the right technical foundation. The SAP Global Trade Services application provides you with an ideal foundation for managing your global trade activity worldwide. COMPLIANCE MASTER DATA AND CONTENT MANAGEMENTSAP GTS lays the foundation for effective trade compliance by acting as the single system of record for all compliance master data and content. The application receives best-in-class content, including complete sanctioned-party lists, rules of origin requirements, customs code lists, and license determination. It also captures master data about business partners, including customers, suppliers, banks, customs offices, data providers, the organizational units of employees, and government agencies. Because SAP GTS integrates directly with SAP S/4HANA , SAP ERP, and other business soft-ware systems, global trade transactions are auto-matically checked for compliance and appropri-ate import or export controls. At the same time, inbound and outbound communication delivers the appropriate transactional content to customs authorities. By performing and recording compliance checks in real time, the trade services application keeps products moving and payments processing.SCREENING OF SANCTIONED-PARTY LISTSSAP GTS supports screening of sanctioned party lists by running real-time compliance checks across sales, finance, human resources, procurement, and distribution departments. When a transaction fails to pass a compliance check, it is blocked for review before it can proceed. Worklists enable efficient processing of blocked documents and partners, and user-friendly workflows escalate questionable entries to superusers for final resolution and entry into the audit trail.The functionality for sanctioned-party-list screening in SAP GTS can be up and running in weeks, either on premise or in the cloud – complete with electronic audit trails and reporting. The functionality integrates with SAP S/4HANA and SAP ERP. With this integration, compliance checks can occur in real time for vastly improved compliance in a rapidly changing regulatory environment. One of the key strengths of SAP Global Trade Services is its deep integration into SAP S/4HANA and SAP ERP, which supports sales, procurement, and logistics processes that are essential to efficient export and import management. 2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.Run Worldwide with SAP Global Trade Services 7 / 16REAL-TIME COMPLIANCE CHECKS AND RELEASES Without direct and real-time integration between your trade management and enterprise business systems, you have to depend on manual interven-tions to stop shipments that need further review. It takes only a small slip to create a domino effect of issues, such as errors in customs declarations, additional shipping fees, and other costs resulting from supply chain delays. Real-time integration between SAP GTS and SAP S/4HANA and SAP ERP enables real-time compliance checks, controls, hard stops, and block resolution worklists and workflows. This functionality helps you keep compliance-related data – and your products – moving as quickly as possible.

SAP HANA includes tools for data modeling, data and lifecycle management, security, operations, reporting, and more. Going forward, we plan to optimize SAP GTS to take advantage of the high-performance functionality delivered by SAP HANA.SAP HANA also supports the analysis of sanctioned-party lists. It accelerates analytics performance and efficiency by providing real-time access to massive amounts of screened sanctioned-party-list data, blocked partners, and documents. Using this optional function, you can accelerate access to screened data, including incomplete documents, audit trails, blocked business partners, and blocked documents, to quickly diagnose and address issues.PRODUCT CLASSIFICATIONTo uniquely identify goods when communicating with regulatory authorities, you need to classify goods according to official classifications. Accurate product classification is the foundation of global trade best practices and often requires collabora-tion with a product engineer and compliance specialist. You may need to maintain many classifications for each product to accommodate various authorities; for example, in the European Union, products require a TARIC code, which is an EU import classification scheme. SAP GTS supports multiple classifications including HS, HTS, TARIC, PGAs, and ECCNs and allows you to: . Establish correct product classification, enabling you to identify and pay the correct amount of duties and tariffs  . Determine product qualification for preferential duty rates . Know if import or export permits or licenses are required . Collect trade statisticsSAP GTS supports multiple numbering schemes for the same product based on legal regulations of the various countries and customs regimes. It also supports mass product classification or mass reclassification, which increases user productivity while keeping product classifications up to date.SAP Global Trade Services supports various classification models, including the Harmonized System, Harmonized Tariff Schedule, Integrated Tariff of the European Communities, and export classification numbers. 2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.Run Worldwide with SAP Global Trade Services 9 / 16EXPORT MANAGEMENTOne of the key strengths of SAP GTS is its deep integration into core logistics processes, which are essential to efficient export management. For example, the application integrates into sales and distribution processes to help ensure compliant and efficient export management, as well as support product classification, sanctioned-party-list screening, export license management and determination, embargo screening, and export customs management.For more complex export transactions (such as those involving International Traffic in Arms Regulations requirements), the application can integrate bills of materials (BOMs) into the license determination process. This allows you to control relevant components and track the flow of controlled goods throughout the procurement, production, and distribution processes. It uses the information from pro forma or commercial invoices as the basis for generating export docu-ments and sending the export declaration to customs authorities through a certified customs interface (where available or required). The receipt of a confirmation from the customs authorities in SAP GTS closes the export process.IMPORT MANAGEMENTSAP GTS provides one of the most comprehensive import management solutions in the industry. The application is tightly integrated with the procurement and inbound logistics processes that are critical to effective import management. It also supports product classification, sanctioned-party-list screening, import license and permit management, embargo screening, and import customs management. SAP GTS is certified for many country customs interfaces such as U.S. Importer Security Filing and U.S. Automated Commercial Environment. SAP GTS creates a customs declaration based on the purchase order, inbound delivery, invoice, or carrier bill of lading. The customs declaration serves as the import entry and includes all details regarding what is being imported. The application checks that all imported products are properly classified; determines if any product is subject to import licenses, permits, or other government agency requirements; and identifies whether these shipments comply with the terms of the import regulation. All relevant data is automatically available for reporting to the appropriate customs authorities. SAP GTS then determines and accu-rately calculates all import duties, taxes, and fees and makes any adjustments to the transaction value. It generates all necessary forms and files electronic customs entries using certified customs interfaces. SAP GTS can use invoices for import processes related to intracompany movement of goods.When one business location exports goods to another location within the same company, the application uses the export invoice to automatically trigger the creation of an import. For global companies with a high volume of these intracompany exports and imports, this automation enables real savings and increased data accuracy.After the goods are imported, the application automatically checks the goods receipt against the import entry and reports any variances. At this point in the process, it provides support for postentry reconciliation, allowing importers to correct any entries flagged as inaccurate. It also receives duty statements from customs and authorization for the settlement of duties through an automated clearing house. 2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

To facilitate the exchange of information with brokers, the application provides Web services to communicate product, export, and import declaration data. These exchanges include brokers returning the declarations that have been filed and completed with customs on the company's behalf.The application supports two scenarios: . Broker centric: A broker initiates a declaration, and a copy is sent back to the company after customs clearance. The company provides the broker with necessary master data to complete the declaration, such as classification and weights. . Importer-exporter centric: The company initiates the process and sends the original import or export declaration to the broker. The broker then requests customs clearance and provides the latest processing status, customs registration number, and other pertinent information.These scenarios are enabled by key capabilities, including: . Transfers of master data . Web services and XML format . Monitoring of customs declarations status . Broker performance evaluations . Sending of import and export declarations to brokers .

Many of these procedures are enabled by the application's ability to track inventory by custom status as goods are entered, stored, consumed in produc-tion, and subsequently entered into domestic commerce or exported. As a result, companies can delay, reduce, or even eliminate duty pay-ments, depending on their ultimate usage and destination. For many companies, this ability becomes increasingly important as global trade plays a larger and more visible role in government policies and actions. Leveraging foreign trade zones, for example, not only reduces costs but also provides a buffer against periods of duty and tariff variability. SAP GTS supports outward processing relief (OPR) to provide relief from custom duty, allowing you to track the export of materials for processing outside their customs territory. SAP GTS then links to the reimport record of the semifinished or finished goods so that importers pay duties only on the value-added foreign content. OPR functionality is integrated into the sales process, including repurchase, subcontracting, and stock transfer scenarios. The application also supports inward processing relief (IPR) capability, which allows you to track imported components through production to the export of the finished goods, as well as divert goods to free circulation. With IPR, you can realize significant savings by minimizing and deferring payment of import duties and value-added taxes (VAT) and by managing customs processes throughout your worldwide manufacturing and distribution facilities. In addition, SAP GTS integrates with the European EMCS – a system for monitoring movements of excisable goods under suspension of excise duty within the European Union (in other words, goods for which excise duties have not been paid). This integration enables your organization to defer or eliminate excise taxes in the European Union. It also manages Intrastat reporting and supports restitution, which enables your company to comply with EU regulations and allows the European agri-cultural industry to compete globally. SAP GTS supports more than 25 certified interfaces for customs and other government agencies. This not only reduces the cost of compliance but also enables organizations to rapidly enter into new markets.SAP Global Trade Services supports more than 25 certified interfaces for customs and other government agencies.

All rights reserved.Run Worldwide with SAP Global Trade Services 12 / 16Optimizing Trade Preference ManagementSAP Global Trade Services offers comprehensive functionality for trade preference management. The application uses content-based rules of origin in preferential trade agreements to deter-mine which products are eligible for reduced import duty rates. When done manually or without the aid of a purpose-built solution, preference determination is costly, error prone, and risky. Typically, it involves manual gathering of vendor declarations, complex analyses of product content origin, and complicated value calculations using BOM data. SAP GTS automates the entire process of determining trade preferences, so your organization can claim duty reductions and comply with each customer's need for vital product-origin certification.FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS Preferred or free trade agreements offer lower duty rates to participating countries or customs regimes. The proliferation of free trade agree-ments worldwide is anticipated to grow signifi-cantly. SAP GTS automates processes required for your company to take advantage of free trade agreements such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA (the agreement to replace NAFTA); the European Union-South Korea Free Trade Agreement; and many others around the world.IDENTIFYING GOODS AS ELIGIBLE FOR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT For most companies, identifying goods as eligible for preferential treatment is usually a manually intensive, error-prone process. Companies oper-ating in a manual or hybrid system environment simply cannot accommodate regulatory require-ments for this area of compliance. As a result, they miss out on the real cash savings offered by free trade agreements. SAP GTS provides comprehensive trade preference management functionality that supports free trade agreements, preferential treatments, vendor declarations, and regional value content calculations. The application streamlines and automates the process of preference determination, including: . Requesting vendor declarations and managing their collection and maintenance . Establishing product origin based on agreement rules . Including the identification of materials down to a detailed level, such as batch or serial number . Issuing customer certificates of origin . Managing multiple trade agreements . Calculating imported and domestic inputs used in finished products based on the rules of origin appliedThe application automates and tracks all required tasks, generating a complete audit trail at every step.LONG-TERM VENDOR DECLARATIONSSAP GTS streamlines the collection and management of required documentation and long-term vendor declarations from suppliers. Tightly integrated with the procurement processes enabled by SAP S/4HANA and SAP ERP, the application allows you to establish the relationship of materials and the vendors they are purchased from. Using this information, SAP GTS determines which vendors are located within the countries included in the different preference zones. It can also generate requests and reminders for long-term vendor declarations of relevant products.  2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.Run Worldwide with SAP Global Trade Services 13 / 16SAP GTS allows your company's suppliers to use Web-based supplier self-services so they can quickly and more easily maintain declarations online. Their inputs are then aggregated and maintained in the application. SAP GTS also integrates with the production and sales processes supported by SAP S/4HANA and SAP ERP so it automatically receives updated copies of the BOMs. It evaluates product classification and preference status for BOMs, using applicable rules of origin to determine which goods qualify for preferential duty treatment. Real-time inte-gration into sales and distribution functionality in SAP S/4HANA or SAP ERP enables the issuing of long-term vendor declarations to customers. By automating the entire process, you can not only save significant time and effort but also minimize the risk of presenting incorrect statements to authorities.REGIONAL VALUE CONTENT CALCULATIONRunning preferred trade agreements without system automation is manually intensive and challenging. Hence, it keeps many companies from realizing the real cash savings offered by trade agreements. SAP GTS keeps track of all preference calculations, transactions, and goods movements – all captured in an electronic audit trail. In addition, it supports both net value and transaction value valuation methods. Preference management functions enable the collection of vendor declarations, preference processing of BOMs (both fixed and order related), preference eligibility determination, and the generation and distribution of preference declarations to customers.  By automating the entire vendor declaration process, SAP GTS not only saves customers significant time and effort but also minimizes the risk of presenting incorrect statements to authorities.SAP Global Trade Services provides comprehensive trade preference management functionality such as support for free trade agreements, preferential treatments, vendor declarations, and regional value content calculations. 2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

Businesses face multiple challenges to comply with processing trade regulations, including performing reconciliations, managing customs BOMs, tracking inventory, and managing customs declarations with match-ing business transactions. SAP GTS, processing trade in China, helps companies minimize risk and reduce duties by centralizing processing trade activities. At the same time, it improves efficiency by automating imports, exports, and e-manual management. Companies can use the application to manage classifications, including supervision codes, declaration elements, and letters of credit, as well as manage legal control, generate export declaration forms, and claim VAT refunds. As the first localized processing trade solution for China from SAP, the application can help your company obtain work orders and goods information directly by processing different codes and processes in your SAP ERP application. As a result, you can save time, lower costs, increase data transparency, and improve efficiency while efficiently managing your processing trade activities. SAP Global Trade Services supports the special customs procedures such as foreign trade zones, processing trade in China, bonded warehouses, outward processing relief, and inward processing relief that provide substantial savings on duties, taxes, and customs fees. 2018 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

Using SAP GTS integrated with SAP TM, large exporters and logistics service providers can create a single export for their entire shipment. For exporters, SAP TM indicates if a shipment is customs relevant; it then sends the freight order to SAP GTS for a compliance check and for creation of the customs declaration. Logistics service providers, on the other hand, create a forwarding order in SAP TM and send it to SAP GTS for a compliance check and customs declaration. Once the customs declaration is completed, SAP GTS sends the customs status to SAP TM indicating that ""export is allowed."" At that point, a shipment is allowed to progress. GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN VISIBILITYSupply chain professionals, customer service representatives, and compliance managers require visibility into international trade activities. To meet this need, SAP GTS extends your global supply chain management solution by integrating with SAP Event Management to provide visibility into the details of all customs operations – both for imports and exports. This enables you to proactively mitigate the risk of unforeseen customs delays. You can also trigger events from defined fields in almost any SAP GTS document.
